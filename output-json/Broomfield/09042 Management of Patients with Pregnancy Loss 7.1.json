It's not unusual for some parents to feel under pressure to have another baby as soon as possible, sometimes to relieve the anxiety of their family and friends who love them and want them to be happy. Some parents feel the need to find out as much as possible as to why their baby died before even considering trying to get pregnant again, to try to prevent losing another baby in a future pregnancy. There may not be nor may reason or cause for your baby's death, and this be very stressful for you to plan another pregnancy. Staff caring for you will offer time to discuss your feelings. This can be offered to you either together as a couple or on your own. Look after yourselves both physically and emotionally, it may help to learn and practice relaxation techniques and eat a healthy diet. A future pregnancy will be stressful but staff caring for you will realise this and should offer additional antenatal support. Some units will offer you a link with a named person that you can contact as soon as you find out that you are pregnant, who can offer help and support."
