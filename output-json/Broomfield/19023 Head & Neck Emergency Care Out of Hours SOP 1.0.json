The SHO will notify the nursing staff on ward E322 for an adult patient and Moonbeam ward (E122) for a child that a patient requires admission. The bed manager/service co-ordinator will be contacted and notified of the admission by the doctor. If no bed is available on ward E322 a bed will have to be found by the bed manager/service co-ordinator on the Broomfield hospital site and the patient will be repatriated to ward E322 as soon as a bed becomes available. If a bed is not available on Moonbeam ward the SHO should contact the Consultant on call for further advice on the management of the child. They should then liaise with Moonbeam ward and the bed manager/ service co- ordinator."
