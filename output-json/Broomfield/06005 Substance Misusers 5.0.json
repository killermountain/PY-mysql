In the same survey, 2% of the population were dependent on cannabis alone and a further 1% on other drugs with or without cannabis. The most frequently used drug was cannabis, with only one per cent of the population reporting the use of heroin and crack-cocaine. Only a minority of those who try drugs will develop problems and require drug treatment but it is particularly the opioid misusing population that poses challenges to the adequate and appropriate management of pain (British Pain Society). Despite the low reported usage of heroin, in a further study it was estimated that in 2006-07, for every 1000 people aged 15-64 years in England, an estimated 8\u00b71 were heroin users (NTA, 2012). Between April 2005 and 2011, 229,788 patients were treated for heroin addiction at some point in the UK; their median length of stay in treatment was about four years. In view of this time treatment line, heroin users represent 2/3 of all people being treated with drug problems. It is one of the most difficult addictions from which to abstain."
