(2019) found that child peak-procedural pain significantly accounted for 6% additional variance (alongside wound depth and size) in the time taken for re-epithelisation. Research demonstrating the link between procedural distress and short and long term psychological distress is vast. Distress during procedures can lead to continuing anxiety, separation anxiety, and problems with sleep, nightmares, irritability and aggressiveness long beyond the period of hospitalisation that can in turn impact on a child's cognitive, social and emotional development."

Many of the children we support will have not yet developed the ability to verbalise their fears and worries about a procedure and when they are experiencing anxiety they are even less likely to be able to clearly tell us what is going on for them. This is why we will often see behavioural distress rather than emotional distress in the children we support. A child who is kicking, screaming, refusing to get undressed to be treated or examined, hitting and/or spitting is likely to be as scared (or perhaps even more so) as a child who is sitting still, crying and shaking."
