For both products (ieoseltamivir and zanamivir), use in pregnant and lactating women is only recommended based on the individual risk benefit assessment of the treating physician. Zanamivir results in significantly less systemic exposure than oseltamivir and therefore also significantly less potential exposure to the foetus. And therefore Relenza is the recommended antiviral for pregnant women."
