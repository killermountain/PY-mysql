An automatic flush mode is activated within the system, which delivers 3 mL per hour, which maintains the patency of the cannula. Wash hands with soap and water, or an alcohol\u2010based handrub, and dry. Prepare a trolley near the patient. Prepare the insertion site with a ChloraPrepTM and place a sterile towel under the appropriate area. Administer adequate local anaesthetic. Put on sterile gloves. An assistant may hold the patient's foot or arm. If the radial artery is cannulated, the wrist can be hyperextended. Promptly return the wrist to the neutral position following cannulation. Insert the cannula and observe for blood flashback. Attach the transducer set and fully open the roller clamp. Arterial cannula can be secured with either Steri-Strips or sutures, depending on clinical setting and projected time of insertion (>24 hours, or for ICU/HDU care must be sutured). Apply a transparent dressing over the cannula and tape the tubing securely. Clearly label the device as arterial, on the dressing as well as on the tubing. Loop the tubing around the thumb, ensuring this is not too tight (appendix 2). Connect the transducer to the monitoring equipment.
