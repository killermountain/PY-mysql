This is based on observational changes that may be associated with pain; this may include behavioural changes, changes in body language, vocalisation, and facial expression. The Abbey scoring system is sometimes referred to as the pain and agitation scale. Agitation can be a sign of a patient in pain. The assessor will observe the patient and score them in each category. The sum of the scores is calculated. The maximum score is 18. A score of 0 to 2 refers to no pain, 3 to 7 refers to mild pain, 8 to  refers to moderate pain, and a score of 14+ refers to severe pain. See Abbey Pain Scale in Table 1 in appendices. This has been modified to reduce subjectivity of the scorer."

For patients with severe & profound learning disabilities, the DisDAT assessment tool and Hospital Passport can be used to identify pain and distress for people who are non-verbal or have extremely limited communication skills. The care provider should provide these tools at point of patient admission. Where the patient is admitted without these resources, then the assessment tools are freely available and can be downloaded from the intranet under the Learning Disability clinical pages.
