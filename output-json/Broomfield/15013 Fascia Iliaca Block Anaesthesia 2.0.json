A large percentage will have significant co-morbidities and are often taking numerous medications. In addition, they may present in A&E with acute medical problems such as chest or urine infections, or heart failure, which may well have been the cause of the fall. This group of patients are likely to be malnourished on admission and show a rapid deterioration in nutritional status during admission. Approximately 40% of this patient group will have at least a moderate degree of cognitive impairment. Untreated or undertreated pain can cause delirium in previously non-cognitively impaired patients, and can also worsen delirium in patients with existing dementia."

The obvious fracture and the severe pain will limit their ability to move. This will have repercussions on being able to carry out their pressure area care, take in adequate food and fluids, and sleep due to the pain, not to mention the body's own neuroendocrine responses and compromised pulmonary function as a sequential reaction to pain. It is in this period where close attention should be focused on optimising pain control, in order to facilitate nutritional and pressure area care, and the provision of work up to get the patient fit for surgery. Surgery is the best analgesic for hip fractures, and AAGBI (2011) and the NICE (2011) guidelines on the management of hip fractures recommend that patients should be operated on within 48 hours of the injury. To re-iterate pain management needs to be optimised in this period."

Fascia iliaca compartment blocks (FICB) have multiple advantages, these include minimal to no haemodynamic changes, in addition to the reduced need for opioids and therefore a reduction in the side effects they can potentially cause, especially in the elderly. They also, when given correctly, can provide great dynamic pain relief until the patient goes to theatre."

The image from a computer-generated model in Fig 4 shows that the needle insertion point (2) lies approximately halfway between the femoral and LFCN allowing local anaesthetic to spread and block these two nerves. Due to muscle bulks separating the obturator nerve from the other two nerves, blockade of the obturator nerve with a single injection during a FICB is at best unreliable, despite its location within the same anatomical compartment."

These observations are to be taken immediately post procedure, and then every 5 minutes for the next 30 minutes, then every 15 minutes for the next hour post FICB. If unintentional IV administration occurs LA toxicity will occur immediately. LA toxicity due to overdose can be generally picked up within 30 minutes post bolus however it is possible for toxicity to occur after this time, therefore continued vigilance is required."
