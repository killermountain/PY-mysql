Ulceration occurs when the skin and underlying tissues are compressed for a period of time, between the bone and the surface, on which the individual is sitting or lying. Blood cannot circulate causing a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the tissue cells. Furthermore, the lymphatic system cannot function properly and remove waste products. If the pressure continues, the cells die and the area of dead tissue that result is called pressure damage.
