Every work activity that has a significant hazard should be assessed for risk. Identification using a systematic approach is critical, because a potential risk not identified at this stage will be excluded from further analysis. See Appendix  for sources of risk identification. The risk identification template in Appendix  can be used to determine how the Trust is likely to be affected by any hazard and its associated risks. The Trust Health and Safety policies should be referred to regarding the process for health and safety assessments required on an annual basis to identify health and safety related risks."
