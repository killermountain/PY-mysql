Rinse well with warm water Room 2 \u2013 Close red valve lever under pool via access door (this will close off drain and allow pipework to be disinfected). Leave plug in drain open.

Clean pool sides and leave for 10 minutes as above Discard the cloth after use Open the tap outlet and empty the pool of the Tristel solution Using cold water, rinse the tap and then the pool to remove all traces of the Tristel solution and prevent any residue being left on the pool surface. Dry the entire surface of the pool using a clean cloth Ensure the outside of the pool is cleaned with Tristel solution Sieves and thermometers are single use and should be disposed of after each delivery To clean the mirror; wash and then rinse in warm water, then soak for a minimum of 30 minutes in a Tristel solution.
