Any form of triage presents ethical and moral dilemmas to clinicians; and a balance has to be struck between the interests of an individual patient and the \u2018common good' or interests of the wider patient population served by the Trust. The greater the common need, the greater the urgency of decision making and need for triage and this should change the emphasis of a clinician's prioritisation accordingly. Clinicians finding themselves in an ethically difficult position should discuss the matter with a senior colleague such as the Medical Director or Nursing Director. Provided that such decisions are properly recorded, the Trust will support such decisions and will accept responsibility for any consequence arising from such a decision."
