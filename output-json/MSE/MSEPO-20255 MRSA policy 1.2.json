Meticillin resistance indicates flucloxacillin resistance and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems). MRSA resistance was first reported in 1961 and MRSA continues to be endemic in many UK hospitals. Specific measures have been shown to be effective in preventing and controlling MRSA, necessary because MRSA can cause serious illness which is harder to treat due to limited therapeutic options and results in additional healthcare costs e.g. as a result of increased length of hospital stay and cost of antibiotics to treat the infection. The emergence of Vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) is further cause for concern."
