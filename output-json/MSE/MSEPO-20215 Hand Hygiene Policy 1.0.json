They are located superficially on the skin and can be readily transferred to the next patient or surface touched; hence they are responsible for the majority of HCAI, for example, Meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. If transferred into susceptible sites such as invasive devices or wounds, these micro-organisms can cause life- threatening infections. Therefore removal of transient organisms from hands is essential in preventing cross-infection, and is easily achieved by washing with soap and water. Alcohol hand rub will also destroy the majority of transient microorganisms but must only be used on visibly clean hands."

They form part of the body's normal defence mechanisms and protect the skin from invasion by more harmful micro-organisms and are not readily transferred to other people or surfaces. They rarely cause disease and are of minor significance in routine clinical situations. However, during surgery or other invasive procedures, resident flora may enter deep tissues and establish infections. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis may cause infection if introduced into susceptible sites, such as surgical wounds and intravenous cannula sites. Resident organisms are not easily removed by routine hand washing using liquid soap and water but will be significantly reduced by the use of antimicrobial cleansing agents such as aqueous chlorhexidine (Hibiscrub) Povidone iodine (Betadine) or alcohol based hand sanitiser."
