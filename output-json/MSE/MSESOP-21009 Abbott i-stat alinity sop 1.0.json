The design enables it to be taken to the patient's bedside (point of care) or a convenient location near the point of care. The instrument requires i\u2011 STAT single-use cartridges containing sensors to perform quantitative diagnostic testing on whole blood. After the insertion of a filled test cartridge, the instrument carefully monitors and controls the testing process. The only user intervention is in the form of data entry. Data entry is performed via the touchscreen or by barcode capture. Throughout the cycle, the instrument performs a series of quality checks. These checks are designed to monitor the status of the instrument and the quality of the cartridge. The instrument and cartridge together allow the user to perform clinical testing and administrative tasks related to in vitro quantification of various analytes in a whole blood sample."
