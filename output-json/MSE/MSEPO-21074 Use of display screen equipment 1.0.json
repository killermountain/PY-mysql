Users should remember that DSE use outside the workplace will also contribute to physical stresses, and should set their home workstations up in a similar way. Ask if the user has been advised of their entitlement to eye and eyesight testing. The Trust will pay for eye testing for all employees who are identified as users. This payment is conditional on production of a receipt for testing from an Optician registered with the General Optical Council, submitted with an expenses form to the line manager. Retesting will usually be allowed every 2 years, except in exceptional circumstances Ask if the user takes regular breaks working away from DSE. Sedentary work, even with good posture should be avoided for prolonged periods. If work breaks (interchanging DSE with other tasks away from the workstation) are not feasible, the User should spend 5 minutes of every hour being active to promote circulation."
