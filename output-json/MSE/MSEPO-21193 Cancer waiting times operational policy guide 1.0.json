Although the 62 day clock will have stopped, it is still important that trusts have systems in place to robustly track these patients to ensure they are followed up appropriately. In this cohort of patients, any future treatment is then classified as a subsequent treatment and monitored using a 31 day subsequent treatment pathway."
