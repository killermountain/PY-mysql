The Coroner may also ask for a forensic pathologist to be present at the retrieval or that photographs are taken or witness statements are obtained from the retrieving surgeons. This may mean that donation can proceed where otherwise it may not have been possible.

This decision must have been made by the donor in life with full capacity and registered with a school of anatomy. The donor would inform the designated individual who has the responsibility to contact the relevant school of anatomy and inform them of the donor's death. At this point suitability would be assessed by the school of anatomy. The Bereavement office will be able to provide further advice on this if required. Some patients may still be able to donate corneas for transplantation."
