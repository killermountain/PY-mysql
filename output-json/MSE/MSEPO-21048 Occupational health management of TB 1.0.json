Tuberculosis, M. bovis or M. africanum) and usually affects the lungs (pulmonary TB). It may however affect almost any other part of the body. The initial infection may be eliminated (heal spontaneously), remain latent (where the individual has no symptoms but the TB bacteria remains in the body) or progress to active TB over weeks or months. Latent TB may reactivate in later life particularly if the individual is immunocompromised either by disease or medical treatment. With few exceptions, only those who develop active TB in the lungs or larynx can infect others, usually by coughing or sneezing (droplet infection). Such transmission is only likely when the index case is smear-positive for the bacillus and after prolonged close contact. It can also be acquired through ingestion of contaminated milk (M. bovis)."
