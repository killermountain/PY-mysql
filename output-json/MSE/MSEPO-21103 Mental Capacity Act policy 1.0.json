The person leading on the individual action is therefore called the decision maker. For example, in the case of change of accommodation, whether temporary or permanent, a Social Worker may be best placed to be the decision maker. Whereas in decisions involving medical treatment or investigations, a clinician would be the decision maker. Further examples can be found in the document SET Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Policy and Guidance (March 2018). It is essential that professionals must work together in the best interest of the individual and agree who is best placed to undertake the assessment, in line with available guidance. This process must never delay or be of detriment to an individual's care or treatment."
