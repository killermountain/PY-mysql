A forced marriage is where one or both people do not (or in some cases of people with learning or physical disabilities, cannot) consent to the marriage and pressure, coercion or abuse is used.

The Act's statutory guidance lists ten types of abuse but states that local authorities should not limit their view of what constitutes abuse or neglect to those types or the different circumstances in which they can take place. It is therefore, also important to recognise that abuse can consist of a single or repeated act(s); that it can be intentional or unintentional or result from a lack of knowledge. Abuse can be an act of neglect or an omission or a failure to act. Abuse can cause temporary harm or exist over a period of time and can occur in any relationship. Abuse can be perpetrated by anyone, individually or as part of a group or organisation. Importantly, abuse can often constitute a crime."

This may be demonstrated by poor hygiene/cleanliness of the person who has been assessed as needing assistance, repeated infections, dehydration/weight loss/ malnutrition, repeated or unexplained falls or trips, withholding of assistance aids e.g. hearing aids or walking devices. Practitioners must respect the rights of the adult whilst seeking to ensure that their behaviour does not harm themselves or others. This means that there is an inherent right for the adult to take risks and a responsibility for the practitioner to help them identify and manage potential and actual risk to themselves and others.
