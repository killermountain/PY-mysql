Note: A sinus wound needs to be flushed with saline to ensure any exudate at the wound base is removed. The remainder of the fluid can then be removed using a wick of gauze before applying the packing. Leave a 2cm tab of ribbon dressing at the wound margin. Do not insert one ribbon dressing on top of another, or tie dressings together to increase the overall length. If more than one ribbon dressing is required, each dressing must be left with a 2cm tab at the wound margin. Do not pack tightly or firmly; the dressing will swell as it absorbs exudate. If the cavity is packed too tightly this may impede free drainage of exudate and may also delay granulation Apply an appropriate secondary dressing depending on anatomical location \u2013 for example wound pad and bandage, or foam bordered adhesive Dressing change frequency will depend on factors such as exudate levels, wound infection, condition of the surrounding skinUse of a Trust approved skin barrier product\u20f0 may be required to protect the peri-wound; this will depend on the outcome of a thorough wound assessment.Reassess the cavity wound at each dressing change and document the outcome in the patient's wound management / pressure ulcer care plan. Update the wound care plan at least weekly, or more frequently if there is a change of wound condition If there are signs of deterioration or wound infection report to the patient's Medical / Surgical Team and refer to the Tissue Viability Service for their support and input."
