Aeruginosa) are opportunistic pathogens, particularly in patients who are immunologically compromised. There can be an association between the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water from taps and other outlets and infection or colonisation in patients in augmented care units. Many of the risks associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water can be mitigated by adhering to good infection prevention and control. As the control methods include providing good hot water to the hospital the risk of scalding and burns from hot water systems is also considered."
