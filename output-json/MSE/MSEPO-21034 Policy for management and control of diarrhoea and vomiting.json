The banner is a highly visible sign which provides information to visitors and staff that the ward is closed as a result of an infection. The sign informs staff and visitors of the situation, and asks them to report to the nurse in charge before seeing a patient. They should be asked to postpone their visit, or if essential for personal reasons, to make their stay as short as possible and not bring in food items. Visitors should be asked to decontaminate their hands on entry and before leaving the ward. Visitors must refrain from sitting on the bed whilst visiting."
