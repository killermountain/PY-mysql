A father, however, has this responsibility only if he is married to the mother when the child is born or has acquired legal responsibility for his child through one of these three routes: (From 1 December 2003) by jointly registering the birth of the child with the mother. By a parental responsibility agreement with the mother. By a parental responsibility order, made by a court. Parental responsibility can only be lost where: In the case of parents their child is adopted. In the case of a person having acquired parental responsibility through a court order that order later being revoked by the court. In the case of a local authority with care order and the court later revoking the care order. In the case of a guardian where the court appoints another guardian"
