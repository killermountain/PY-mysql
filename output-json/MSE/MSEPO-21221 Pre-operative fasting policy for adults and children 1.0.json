A recent study of 10,000 children, over a 6 year period, drinking free fluids up until the time of surgery does not increase their risk of aspiration2. This is supported by Schmidt et al3 , who showed there was no change in gastric pH or volume after 1 or 2 hours fasting. There is also ample evidence from radio-nucleotide studies that the time taken for more than 80% of clear fluid to exit the stomach is less than 1 hour4. Furthermore, if glucose is included in children's clear fluid then gastric emptying is significantly quicker5."
