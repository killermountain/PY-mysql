To lessen the patient's risk of developing a pressure ulcer, it is important to reduce the time and the amount of pressure the patient is exposed to. If damage not associated with pressure, friction or shear is noted, other possible causes need to be identified, such as epidermal stripping due to traumatic removal of tapes or dressings, eczematous skin, sweat or incontinence.
