A prodromal phase (early warning signs) of two to four days starts with fever, conjunctivitis, cough, coryza (runny nose) and Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa (spots inside the mouth, in line with the molars). Exposed individuals are highly infectious from the beginning of this prodromal phase to four days after the appearance of the rash. The rash is made up of red or brown blotches which flow into each other. It usually starts behind the ears and spreads downwards over the face, neck and body and lasts 5-6 days. Other symptoms may include diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain."
