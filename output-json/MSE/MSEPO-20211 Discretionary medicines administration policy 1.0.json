If affected do not drive or operate machinery. Avoid alcoholic drink. Although most antihistamines should be avoided by patients with porphyria, chlorphenamine maleate has been used and is thought to be safe. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine (maltitol content). This medicine may enhance the sedative effects of alcohol, hypnotics, anxiolytics, sedatives, opioid analgesics and neuroleptics. The antimuscarinic effects of chlorphenamine are enhanced by other antimuscarinic drugs and both antimuscarinic and sedative effects are enhanced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (concurrent therapy with which is contraindicated, see 4.3 above) and tricyclic antidepressants. Metabolism of phenytoin may be inhibited by chlorphenamine with the possible development of phenytoin toxicity."
