The users will then mark off any elements within the selected room that are found to be not clean (i.e., the locker is dirty, the window is smeared, etc.) and these results are then saved back up to the server with nothing being saved/left on the device. For your information though, we are in the process of creating an application that WILL store the above data (what elements were found to be not clean in which rooms/areas) on the mobile device (this has not been completed yet and so Allison and her colleagues do not have it). We do not think though that this is critical or sensitive information. In short, we do not believe that any sensitive (or critical) information is held on the mobile device in relation to carrying out C4C audits (now or in the future)."
