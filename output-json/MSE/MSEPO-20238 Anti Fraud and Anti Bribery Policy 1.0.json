A Fraudster is a person who dishonestly makes a false representation to make a gain for himself/herself or another person or dishonestly fails to disclose to another person, information which is under a legal duty to be disclosed, or commits fraud by abuse of position, including any offence as defined in the Fraud Act 2006.

Bribery does not always result in a loss. The corrupt person may not benefit directly from their deeds; however, they may be unreasonably using their position to give some advantage to another.
