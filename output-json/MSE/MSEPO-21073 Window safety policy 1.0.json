The relevant tests for restrictors cited in BS EN 14351-1 and BS EN 13126-5 have been developed to prevent accidental falling from windows. BS EN 14351-1 recommends that restrictors must be able to hold a window in place for  seconds when a static load of  newtons is applied to that window. However, these static loads may not be sufficient to prevent determined patients who want to force the window beyond its 100 mm restriction. None of the British and European Standards deal with deliberate attempts to defeat the restrictor using impact forces, which may be the situation encountered in hospitals and care homes. In the absence of an established performance standard, it is recommended that loads on window restrictors used in healthcare are tested using forces in excess of those quoted in BS EN 14351 and BS EN 13126-5. (Note also that BS EN 13126-5 recommends a maximum opening of 89 mm to prevent the passage of small children.) Two publications (see below) contain the most up-to-date ergonomic data on adult push forces from a standing position. The data in these documents can be used as a guide to the amount of force to be exerted when testing the restrictor."
