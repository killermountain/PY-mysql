Significant harm is a concept that has no absolute criteria or definition.

Significant harm is commonly a compilation of significant events but can be a single traumatic event. Consideration should always be given to the severity of the ill treatment, duration and frequency of abuse or neglect, extent of premeditation and the presence of threat, coercion, sadism and bizarre or unusual elements. It is the responsibility of Social Services to make a judgement of whether the threshold for a Section 47 enquiry has been met (The Children's Act (1989) S31.2)."
