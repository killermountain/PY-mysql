Infection reduction programmes can only be demonstrated as being effective if accurate rates of infection are known. Incorporation of an effective surveillance programme with regular feedback of results to clinical staff is recognised as crucial to the development of action plans to facilitate reductions in the incidence of HCAIs. Clinical Divisions, in partnership with the infection Control Teams will decide upon appropriate surveillance programmes. The Divisions will be responsible for the implementation of surveillance with close collaboration and support from the Infection Control Team. Adequate staffing and good management arrangements will be needed to ensure success and the Trust will review the resources available to support the surveillance programme. The Infection Control Teams will, alongside the infection control site leads, review the results of the surveillance programmes on a monthly regular basis and produce action plans aimed at reducing the level of HCAI."
