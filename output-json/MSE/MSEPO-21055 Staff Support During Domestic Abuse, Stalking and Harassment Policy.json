Violence and abuse can occur when perpetrators perceive that a relative has shamed the family and / or community by breaking their honour code. Most honour based violence is perpetrated by husbands against wives, and fathers against daughters, but males can also be victimised, for example if they are gay or are believed to be supporting the victim. The following incidents can be triggers for abuse and violence in the name of honour: Having a boyfriend Rejecting a forced marriage Being lesbian or gay Becoming pregnant outside of marriage Having an interfaith relationship or a relationship with someone from a different social or cultural group Leaving a marriage or seeking divorce Not conforming to a dress code Victims are sometimes pressurised or tricked into going abroad where they are then killed. Honour Based Violence can be distinguished from other forms of violence, as it is often committed with some degree of approval and/or collusion from family and/or community members. Such crimes cut across all cultures, nationalities, faith groups and communities. They transcend national and international boundaries."
