It is however recognised that such an approach may place an undue burden on staff, and if it can be demonstrated that the chlorine levels in the feed water are consistently low (<0.5 mg/L) and chloramines are not used, then weekly monitoring of the dialysis water is sufficient. However, if chloramines are used and the level of total chlorine in the feed water exceeds 1.0 mg/L, daily or shift based monitoring should be adopted."
