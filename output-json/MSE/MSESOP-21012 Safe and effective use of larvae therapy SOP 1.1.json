However, for chronic, non-healing or hard to heal wounds (for example pressure ulcers, complex leg ulcers, non-healing surgical wounds, diabetic foot ulcers), the healing process is interrupted, and the normal progress towards healing is stalled. These wounds are often characterised by the presence of large quantities of necrotic, sloughy or infected tissue within the wound bed. This tissue delays healing, can harbour bacteria with potential for local or systemic infection with risk of sepsis, and prevents accurate wound assessment by obscuring the extent of tissue destruction. Where clinically appropriate this tissue must be debrided (removed)."
